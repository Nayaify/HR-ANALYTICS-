# HR-ANALYTICS-
Objective:

I analyzied HR data to identify patterns and key factors that contribute to employee attrition, and to support the HR team in creating strategic retention plans using data-driven insights

üìÇ Dataset Description:

The dataset contains detailed records for each employee, including:
Demographic Info: Age, Age Group, Gender, Marital Status

Employment History: Years at Company, Years in Current Role, Years since last Promotion
Performance Metrics: Job Satisfaction, Environment Satisfaction, Relationship Satisfaction, Performance Rating
Financial Data: Monthly Income, Monthly Rate, Salary Slab, Overtime, Stock Option Level
Attrition Status: Attrition Count, Whether the employee has left the organization


 Tools Used:
 
- Excel (Dataset Preparation)
- Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
- Power BI (Data Visualization)

üìÅ Dataset Overview:

- Employment Count: 1,480 employees
- Attrition Count: 238 employees
- Attrition Rate: 16%
- Average Salary: $6,500
- Average Age: 37 years

 Key Insights:
 
 Attrition by Education:
- Life Science employees had the highest attrition
- Medical followed closely behind

Attrition by Age Group:
- Employees aged 26-35 had the highest attrition rate

Attrition by Salary:
- Employees earning up to $5000 showed the most attrition

Attrition by Years at the Company:
- Employees with 59 years at the company had the highest attrition
 
 Attrition by Job Role:
-Research Scientist had the highest attrition count among all roles


‚úÖRecommendations

Based on my findings, here are some key strategies to help reduce attrition:

- Enhance Career Progression for Mid-Level Employees
Design clear career paths and development plans for employees with 4‚Äì6 years of tenure.
Offer leadership training or role enrichment opportunities to prevent stagnation.

- Address Role-Specific Pain Points
Conduct focused engagement sessions with Research Scientists to understand challenges and expectations.
Improve team dynamics, project variety, and recognition programs in R&D teams.

- Competitive Compensation Review
Re-evaluate the salary structure, especially for employees earning below $5,000.
Introduce performance-based bonuses or skill-based incentives to increase satisfaction.

- Targeted Retention for Younger Talent
Create mentorship programs, learning opportunities, and clear growth tracks for employees aged 26‚Äì35.
Communicate internal mobility options and success stories to build long-term engagement.

- Tailored Support Based on Educational Background
Investigate why employees with Life Sciences and Medical degrees are leaving at higher rates.
Align job roles with their skills and provide continuous education or cross-functional exposure to increase engagement.

Use Case
This dashboard is useful for:
- HR Managers monitoring turnover trends

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges:
   
-Incomplete or Inconsistent Data
Some employee records were missing key information like years at the company, job satisfaction, years at current role etc. This required extra cleaning and assumptions, which may have slightly impacted accuracy.

-Ambiguity in Role Definitions
Certain job roles, like Research Scientist, lacked detailed descriptions, making it difficult to understand exactly why these roles had higher attrition without further context.

-Limited Context Behind Attrition
While I could see who left and when, the why behind each exit wasn‚Äôt always available in the data. Factors like workplace culture, leadership style, or personal reasons weren‚Äôt captured.

-Small Sample Size for Certain Categories
Some education types or job roles had very few employees, which limited how much we could generalize the findings for those groups.

No External Benchmarking
We didn‚Äôt have access to industry-wide attrition data for comparison, which made it difficult to determine if the observed trends were unique to the company or part of a wider trend.

  üìå Conclusion:
This analysis has shed light on critical patterns of employee attrition that are tied to education, job roles, salary, age, and years of service. By taking targeted action based on these insights, the organization can strengthen employee satisfaction, improve retention, and reduce the long-term cost of turnover.
